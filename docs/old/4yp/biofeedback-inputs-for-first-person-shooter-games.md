In this paper, we examine how the Biofeedback can be used to improve user experience while playing the first person shooter game. Biofeedback is used to feed the body information of a real person to the game. Therefore, we are going to control and enhance a FPS game using some physiological functions of a human by mapping with the game character. We demonstrate the concept through a simple video game using two sensors to detect the physiological states of the real player. Those two sensor devices are called as OpenBCI, which catches the Electrocardiography (ECG) signal and the Electrooculography (EOG) signal and Galvanic skin response sensor, which capture the skin conductance. Using these measurements, we can check the playerâ€™s excitement, eye movement, and the tiredness at the moment. If the excitement level become higher and the tiredness become lower, the speed of the player will be increase, targeting for an aim will be high and generating enemies per time will be increase. If the excitement level became lower and the tiredness become higher, all the previous results will be happen in opposite way. If player looks left side, the screen will rotate left side by 15 degrees and for right side screen will rotate right side by 15 degrees. The major aim of this project is leads players to feel as real life experience while playing. Moreover, the game become addictive when it has this kind of features. In addition, another goal of adding this feature to the game is to control our body ourselves.
