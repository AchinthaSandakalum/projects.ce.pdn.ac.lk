In recent years, social media emerged as a powerful resource to improve the management of crisis situations such as disasters triggered by natural hazards. In this project we focus on disasters triggered by natural hazards like floods, tsunami and cyclones. The objective of the work is to develop a system that can be employed in natural disaster management. Disaster management is the creation of plans through which communities reduce vulnerability to hazards and cope with disasters. A disaster management model, which implements social media data mining techniques, can help the house holders in protecting their lives and properties from severe damages, based on the data retrieved from social media like facebook and twitter. Data mining is a powerful technology for the extraction of hidden predictive and actionable information from large databases that can be used to gain deep and novel insights. Using data mining techniques on social media, the area which is going to be affected by a disaster, the spreading direction of a disaster and some other very useful features can be predicted.
