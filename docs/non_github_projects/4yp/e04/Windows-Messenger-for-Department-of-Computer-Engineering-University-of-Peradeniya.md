This is a messenger system that we can use for text messaging, audio chatting, audio conferencing and video chatting. This application is based on both Web and desktop applications. Once you logged in to the system, you can add your friends and can view their profiles. There are public and private chat rooms where you can connect and chat with others and some network games too.
