permalink: /4yp/e15/Optimizing-Mitochondria-Genome-Assembly-And-Annotation-With-Skim-Sequencing-Data
description: "Genome sequencing and genome assembly are the computational process of converting the sequence composition of the gene within the cell of an organism in a human readable form. Mitochondria is an important genome in the cell and there is a need to study this genome for various reasons."
