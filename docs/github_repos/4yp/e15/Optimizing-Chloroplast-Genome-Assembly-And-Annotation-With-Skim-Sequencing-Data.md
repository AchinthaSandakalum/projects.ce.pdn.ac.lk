title: Optimizing Chloroplast Genome Assembly And Annotation With Skim Sequencing Data
permalink: /4yp/e15/Optimizing-Chloroplast-Genome-Assembly-And-Annotation-With-Skim-Sequencing-Data
description: "n this project, we will research the existing procedures for chloroplast genome assembly and annotation, and work on developing the methods to identify and select the optimal set(s) of data and the procedures to assemble a given chloroplast genome as accurately and efficiently as possible, by using computational, statistical & heuristical methods.
