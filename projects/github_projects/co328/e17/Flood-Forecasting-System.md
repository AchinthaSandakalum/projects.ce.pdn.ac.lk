title: Flood Forecasting System
permalink: /co328/e17/Flood-Forecasting-System/
description: "Mi Oya Basin is heavily affected by seasonal flooding and droughts. As per the available data, floods in the Mi Oya basin are unleashed due to river overflow and reservoir spilling. Out of the several reservoirs located in the basin, Tabbowa and Inginimitiya are crucial in worsening the flood impacts as these two reservoirs are frequently spilling under adverse weather conditions. As such, the prevalence of a real-time flood forecasting model with the incorporation of the reservoir operations for the entire basin is essential to alleviate the flood induced impacts while preserving the optimum volume of water in the major reservoirs in the basin. In this project our main objective is to implement a Real-time flood forecast models incorporated with reservoir operations for the entire basin to minimize the flood impacts and fill the reservoirs at optimum capacity."
