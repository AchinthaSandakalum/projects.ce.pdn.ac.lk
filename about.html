                The Department of Computer Engineering is the youngest department of the Faculty of Engineering,
                University of Peradeniya. Read more about department history â†’ <a
                    href="http://www.ce.pdn.ac.lk/department-history">http://www.ce.pdn.ac.lk/department-history</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Every student of the faculty has been required to conduct a final year thesis project from the inception
                of
                the faculty. Computer Engineering was no different. Every student has completed a thesis project with
                (individually or as a group) in the final two semesters of the undergraduate.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, computer engineering was one of the first departments to introduce projects to the majority of
                the
                academic courses in every year. This approach to sharpen the technical skills through practical projects
                has
                proven to be very successful through the years. As of 2020, many departments of the faculty have adopted
                this technique.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, in XXX the department has started experimenting with unified projects. The objective of this
                approach is to let students build up connections between the knowledge and skills gained in different
                courses. A massive success has been achieved through this techniques. As of 2020, the department is
                trying
                to have at least XX such unified projects through the undergraduate (this is in addition to the thesis
                project and course projects).
            </p>
            <p>
                Several attempts have been undertaken to preserve the records and codebases of the projects being
                conducted
                in the department [link1 , link2, link3]. This website is the successor of those attempts. We hope to
                maintain a sustainable repository for such information here.
